======================

A Craig Ferguson The Late Late Show soundboard app using Titanium I built a while ago as a learning project.

Problems:
  - Hitting the sound buttons repeatedtly cause it to freeze up, giving it a few seconds to catch up works. This hasn't been tested so it could just be the slow emulator
  - Only built for Android so will need to add in code to compile for iOS as well I think

On the other hand, having a few bugs fits in with the quality of graphics, etc... on the Late Late Show :) This ones for you Craig!
